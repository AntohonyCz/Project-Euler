Project Euler Solutions
  Welcome to my collection of optimized solutions for Project Euler. 
  This repository is a personal effort to solve mathematical and computational problems with a focus on performance and clarity

About:
  This repository includes solutions implemented in Python, aiming to:
    ·Use efficient algorithms to reduce runtime.
    ·Explore different approaches (e.g., brute-force, dynamic programming, mathematical shortcuts).
    ·Practice clean and readable code.
  
  Each file corresponds to a specific problem, named accordingly (e.g., euler15math.py for Problem 15 with a mathematical solution).

How to Run:
  Make sure you have Python installed, in terminal:
      python euler15math.py

  For problems that require input or arguments, adapt the script accordingly.

Contributions:
  At this stage, this is a personal learning project. Suggestions and feedback are welcome!
